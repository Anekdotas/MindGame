13:00 - 16:00:
Configuring and Trying to run Kotlin code on a FreeBSD and Ubuntu server

16:00 - Meeting start

Aras - Setting up server in VU infrastructure that can be accessed via kotlin code
Andrej - Testing multi-window android app environment, trying window template for uploading data (to server)
Vidmantas - Learning basics of git version control, testing modular system for file reading
16:45 Conflict resolution:
--Before any accusations can be made, we, as a team, have to figure out which part(s)
of our system (server, app, database, etc.) is causing a problem
--In case of a two-person conflict, the third member must be present during "dissucssions" to prevent unproductive behavior (ex. insults)
16:50 Discipline rules:
--avoid distractions that are unrelated to project work
--look into discord bots for managing meeting flow (simmilar to teams raising a hand)
17:05 Social life:
--Thursday live meeting are optional, but reccomended. We can take time off the project to have fun toghether if we want
--If PBL goes fully remote we HAVE TO meet in person at least twice per week
